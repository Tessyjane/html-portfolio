<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>

My name is Chioma, and I am a tech enthusiaist. It has really been an exciting journey rekindling my love for web design and development.
I have been having so much fun!

<p>The journey so far has had its highs and lows, but I cannot have it any other way. There have been times when I wanted to give up, because the learning process was overwhelming, but thinking about the opportunities this skill 
  will bring me in the future is what has kept me going.
</p>

<p>I look forward to creating and working on meaningful and impactful projects in the future with my newly acquqired skills which will change the society we live in for the better.</p>
